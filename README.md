DirectX Marching Cubes
=========

Marching Cubes algorithm implementation with DirectX / C++. Heavy lifting done on the geometry shader.

## How to use
For now the only way to use the program is to download the project, fix DirectX SDK paths if needed, run the project and observe the results.
- To change the precision of the resulting geometry, change the data size (height, depth, width) variables in the beginning of DirectXApp::setupVisualizationData().
- To change how the geometry is coloured, play with the variables that are named something related to colors in the geometry shader.
- To visualize different kinds of density data, select (comment/uncomment) one of the functions in the beginning of VolumetricData::CreateTestData(). The descriptions of the images below have the name of the function that was used to create the densities for that image in the parentheses.
